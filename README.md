learning-node
=============

Working my way through the learnyounode tutorial

I would like to thank Tom Wilson (twilson63) for presenting this to our Iron Yard class. Very cool stuff.

Currently I am following along with the exercise in a single project.js file and creating module.js files as needed.

I will probabaly serparate things out into separate files and folders at some point.

For now having it all in one place helps me remember what I have learned so fara.
